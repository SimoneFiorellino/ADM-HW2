# considerations about results #

**all the analysis made in the main file can give useful insights to improve store performance.
 In the following lists, some advice is given relatively to results in each research question:**

## RQ1 ##

as it was expected, the view events are the most numerous, given that they are a compulsory stage in the customer journey. 
the goal of the site should be to maximize the number of puchase events relatively to view events.
In this process, there is an intermediate stage that is adding to cart. This event has an higher frequency than purchase events, 
which means that a few customers reconsider their choice before 
effective purchase or different products are added and then, among them, is choosen the final product to purchase. 
the average time of views before adding a product to carts has resulted as almost 6 times. the aim of the site should be to decrease this number, 
in order to limit the "reconsideration risk" 
of a particular customer. In facts the quicker the customer journey the more probable a customer will buy a product.
According to our results, the probability that a product will be, after being added to cart, purchased is 57%. The closer this data is to 100% the better is for the site.
To achieve that, it may be improved, for instance, the product visualization on the site, using more immersive graphics and more detailed information on the products. 
An other related data is the average time from view event to add to cart event. as before, the longer is this time-distance, the more probable the customer will not 
purchase the item in the end. In this case from our analysis emerges an average time of 30 hours. a tactic to diminish that value may be, for example, sending 
e-mails and notifications to the user (as Amazon.com does) with additional informative material regarding the product and similar ones. Furthermore, in case 
of longer lenghts between view event and add to cart event, may be helpful to offer some discounts to the user. This approach may limit the risk of no purchasing at all on the site.

## RQ2 ##

knowing the categories and subcategories of the most viewed and purchased products can be very helpful to the site in order to understand where to focus on mostly.
Relatively to the first 100 trending products, it resulted that the majority of sales belongs to electronics. So it is likely that the platform deals mainly with 
electronics and, if electronics sales are profitable, this category has to be the principal area of interest for the site. A similar, but more detailed result, 
comes from the most visited subcategory analysis, in which smartphones play a significant role in site sales. The fundamental role of electronics is corroborated
also from the analysis of the 10 most sold products for category: the tenth most sold product for electronics sells around 4 times more than the most sold product for 
appliances, the second most important category. 

## RQ3 and RQ4 ##

Categories and sub-categories are not the only sets to take into account. there are somes cases in which a subcategory or even an entire category is represented by a particular 
brand. Understanding what are the most important brands sold can help the e-commerce platform in reaching its objectives. in the analysis has been taken as example the average 
price for brands in computers category. in that case, there are mainly normal brands and only two premium brands like Apple and Dreammachines. Premium brands are usually 
the ones that have an higher marginal revenue on the product, so having more of them in the site may help in increasing profits. In the site the mean average brand price 
for october and november has been around 180 euros and more than 75% of brands don't go beyond 230 euros on average. this price may seem relatively high, however it has to be considered that the site sells, as said before, mostly electronics
which are characterized, on average, by medium-high prices. If the site wants to increase revenues, a strategy may be to increase the number of premium brands in the
catalogue. In the analysis, has been measured also the revenue performance of brands between october and november. the worst 3 brands have lost more than 90% of revenues between the 
preceding and the successive month. This decrease may be the effect of a contigent event external to the site, however it is necessary to find the causes which have brought about
such a steep decrease.

## RQ5 ##

an important information is the time evolution of views for the site. In particular, it is extremely significant the evolution in time, especially in specific 
moments of the year (e.g. christmas). In the analysis has emerged that the period in which the number of views is maximum is between friday and sunday 
whereas the hour in which there are more views is 4 p.m. So, given these two results, the store should be more active in these periods. This can be done by
introducing more offers where the number of views is maximized, so that more viewers will be informed about discounts. 

## RQ6 ##

The conversion rate is a meausure which can give an idea of store performance. The conversion rate is given by the ratio between purchases and views events. 
It includes both cases in which the view event is followed by the purchase event and cases in which the view event is not followed by any purchase. Observing 
the trend during a certain period gives a feedback to management whether their actions have been effective or not. In the conversion rate analysis for each category
has emerged that the electronics, which represent the larger slice of store sales, has a lower conversion rate than many other categories. This may be a warning to 
management, because it may be a signal that the store is not focusing on the right objectives and it is disregarding the most lucrative products. 

## R7 ##

Business performance is strictly related to clients loyalty. A solid customer basis may be very helpful, especially in troubled times. 
Furthermore, for a company, is much less costly retain existing customers than acquiring new ones.
The pareto principles states that, 
on average, the 80% of consequences are generated by 20% of causes. This principle in retail can be sum up as the 20% of clients generates the 80% of purchases. 
According to our results, only the 67% of purchases are generated by the 20% of the customers. This may be a signal that there are not so many loyal customers. The
e-commerce retailer should aim to increase the basis of loyal customers using tactics such as loyalty rewards like offers for customers who purchase more on the site.
This may healp to reach and exceed the pareto equilibria of 80/20 which can strenghten the store in the long run.
